    "## Different reference yields different results, but not very\n",

    "As with relative event locations, the quality of relative moment tensors depend on the quality of their absolute reference. The results can't be better than the reference you are parsing. Relative moment tensors are best defined for events of similar magnitude. This ows to the fact that the relative amplitudes are meassured within a common frequency band below the corner frequency of the larger event and that noisy frequencies should be avoided. For illustration, let us consider the figures created in the previous example.\n",

    "The left image shows the resulting relative MTs using as reference the smaller event *7508* ($M_W = 4.1$), the right image with the larger event *7640* ($M_W = 5.0$). Both images are colored by the RMS of the Kagan angles of all bootstrap realizations, larger numbers indicate less stable (reliable) results. The reference MT is highlighted with red outlines. Double coulple components > 20% are superimposed as lines. \n",

    "We see in the figure above that both realizations yield similar results. The majority of the events are of strike-slip faulting type. A few moment tensors indicate normal faulting, a few reverse faulting. We recognize that the strike-slip events tend to resemble the reference MT, that is, in the left figure they are almost purely strike slip, while in the right figure they exhibit a slight normal-faulting component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some properties of the results indicate that it is favorable to use the smaller event *7508* as a reference (left), instead of the  larger event (*7640*, right). When using the smaller event, we see that all but one MT (*8135*) have a DC component > 20%, while when using the larger event, we find 3 such MTs. As we are looking at tectonic earthquakes, we would expect the results to have a large DC component. Additionally, the maximum Kagan angle RMS is about 20° for the *7508* reference, while it is 27° for the *7640* reference, indicating less stable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between both images there is a trend that the more an individual MT result differs dependent on the choice of reference MT (between left and right), the higher the Kagan angle RMS. This indicates that the Kagan RMS is a good measure for detecting outliers. One important exception from this correlation is event *3384*, which is a normal faulting event in the left figure, but a strike slip event in the right figure. Both faulting types occur again in the data set, so neither MT can be declared as an outlier."
